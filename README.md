I started my coding journey in September 2020 after turning my hand to a few different jobs and much deliberation post-university about what career path I wanted to follow. I started by learning JavaScript followed by Ruby and was delighted to find out it ticked all of the boxes. I relish in the problem-solving, the chance to be creative, the collaborative nature of coding and the opportunity to constantly be learning and growing. Having studied Philosophy at university I am well suited to detail oriented work and lateral thinking. In both coding and Philosophy you have to break something down to the smallest part to see if it holds up under scrutiny or if there are other routes that are better to take. Both disciplines get to the root of a bigger picture - the way the world works for Philosophy and the way technology works for coding!

I have just started a four month intensive coding bootcamp (Makers Academy) where I will go from an amateur coder to a confident full-stack junior developer. I am looking to take on a career in Bristol in an environment that constantly challenges me and expands my knowledge of software development. 

## Skills

**Competence**

While working as a licensing co-ordinator for Leeds Festival I was thrown into a role that I had very little experience in and I really had to learn quickly on the job. I took it all in my stride and found the balance between asking for help when I needed it and using my initiative to independently find solutions to problems I was faced with. Towards the end of this job I was confident and competent in my role.

**Collaboration**

I appreciate the importance of cohesive teamwork in order to effectively achieve goals. While leading distributions in Calais this team mentality was essential. As we were working in a humanitarian crisis it could become tense or unsafe in the field and every team member had to know that if they wanted to exit the field their choice would be respected and would not be second-guessed. To nurture this trust within the team I comprehensively briefed everyone before, continued to check on each member during the distribution and debriefed with the team after to talk about how the distribution went and what we could improve on. 

**Compassion**

It is hard to have effective teamwork without compassion, which is something I aim to bring to every workplace I am in. Along with other volunteers I developed a safer-spaces policy that we went through with every new volunteer. This encouraged people to leave preconceptions and to study internal biases that we all have. In turn this resulted in a supportive and welcoming environment with everyone being able to work to best of their ability. 

**Commitment**

I started by teaching myself to code and have recently started a 4 month coding bootcamp. Both of these have required independent learning which demands discipline, drive and focus.
