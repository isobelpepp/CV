I started my coding journey in September 2020 after turning my hand to a few different jobs and much deliberation post-university about what career path I wanted to follow. I found that I really enjoyed the problem-solving nature of it, the opportunity for growth and learning and the chance for collaboration. I completed Makers Academy in September 2021, a four month intensive coding bootcamp. I am currently working as a junior software developer on a [college database management system](https://wtc-consulting.co.uk/cdms) using Vue.js, Express, Node.js and MongoDB.

## Skills

**Competence**

While working as a licensing co-ordinator for Leeds Festival I was thrown into a role that I had very little experience in and I really had to learn quickly on the job. I took it all in my stride and found the balance between asking for help when I needed it and using my initiative to independently find solutions to problems I was faced with. Towards the end of this job I was confident and competent in my role. This skill has meant that while learning how to code I have been able to pick up concepts quickly and thrived in an independent learning environment. 

**Collaboration**

I appreciate the importance of cohesive teamwork in order to effectively achieve goals. While leading distributions in Calais this team mentality was essential. As we were working in a humanitarian crisis it could become tense or unsafe in the field and every team member had to know that if they wanted to exit the field their choice would be respected and would not be second-guessed. To nurture this trust within the team I comprehensively briefed everyone before, continued to check on each member during the distribution and debriefed with the team after to talk about how the distribution went and what we could improve on. This proved particularly useful while working on group projects, where we did a check-in with each other at every stand up and retro and carved a space for people to express any concerns. Making sure we all knew where everyone was at (practially and personally) was crucial in ensuring we could get the best out of the team.

**Compassion**

It is hard to have effective teamwork without compassion, which is something I aim to bring to every workplace I am in. Along with other volunteers I developed a safer-spaces policy that we went through with every new volunteer. This encouraged people to leave preconceptions at the door and to study internal biases that we all have. In turn this resulted in a supportive and welcoming environment with everyone being able to work to best of their ability. This skill translated well into group projects and fostered a positive environment for the team to work in which inevitably led to more efficient, successful work towards a product.

**Commitment**

I have played sport from a young age, at county and regional level which required early mornings and weekends taken up by it. I sustained an injury a few years ago and my road to recovery has required huge commitment and resilience, having to bounce back after the diagnosis turned out to be wrong or the prescribed exercises were not working out. This skill was vital in the four months I studied at Makers Academy which demanded discipline, drive and focus. Having to learn so much in a relatively short space of time was at points overwhelming but I managed to pick myself up when it felt too much and kept pushing forwards!

**Creativity**

I have found that coding often requires lateral thinking and an ability to be creative in your solutions. This was a skill I honed while studying Philosophy - as a discipline it made one boil down arguments to the smallest part and think of any way that it could break under scrutiny. I have found this has been very useful when it comes to software development in that you have to break down projects into the most simple elements in order to build the bigger picture.
