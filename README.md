I started my coding journey in September 2020 after turning my hand to a few different jobs and much deliberation post-university about what career path I wanted to follow. I have just completed a four month intensive coding bootcamp (Makers Academy) and I am looking to take on a career in software development that constantly challenges me and expands my knowledge of software development.

## Skills

**Competence**

While working as a licensing co-ordinator for Leeds Festival I was thrown into a role that I had very little experience in and I really had to learn quickly on the job. I took it all in my stride and found the balance between asking for help when I needed it and using my initiative to independently find solutions to problems I was faced with. Towards the end of this job I was confident and competent in my role.

**Collaboration**

I appreciate the importance of cohesive teamwork in order to effectively achieve goals. While leading distributions in Calais this team mentality was essential. As we were working in a humanitarian crisis it could become tense or unsafe in the field and every team member had to know that if they wanted to exit the field their choice would be respected and would not be second-guessed. To nurture this trust within the team I comprehensively briefed everyone before, continued to check on each member during the distribution and debriefed with the team after to talk about how the distribution went and what we could improve on. 

**Compassion**

It is hard to have effective teamwork without compassion, which is something I aim to bring to every workplace I am in. Along with other volunteers I developed a safer-spaces policy that we went through with every new volunteer. This encouraged people to leave preconceptions and to study internal biases that we all have. In turn this resulted in a supportive and welcoming environment with everyone being able to work to best of their ability. 

**Commitment**

The four months I studied at Makers Academy was very focused on independent learning which demanded discipline, drive and focus. It was a real commitment to make and is an example of when I put my mind to something I really give it my all.

**Creativity**

I have found that coding often requires lateral thinking and an ability to be creative in your solutions. This was a skill I honed while studying Philosphy - as a discipline it made one boil down arguments to the smallest part and think of any way that it could break under scrutiny. I have found this has been very useful when it comes to software development in that you have to break down projects into the most simple elements in order to build the bigger picture.
